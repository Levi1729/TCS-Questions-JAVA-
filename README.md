### PC Specs and Software Specs
I have used an Windows PC (DELL Precison 3470) with 12th Gen i7-1270P (12 cores and 16 logical processors) processor. I have used JDK 22.0.1 and IntelliJ Idea Community Edition for executing the programs.

#### What to do?
Make sure you have Java installed on your machine. Then copy code, paste it in and IDE and execute it. It works fine.
